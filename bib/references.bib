	abstract = {The adoption of Sustainable Agricultural Practices (SAPs) remains high
on the policy and research agenda in most of sub-Saharan Africa. This
paper adopts an integrative approach to investigate how psycho-social
and socioeconomic factors influence the uptake of SAPs by smallholder
farmers in Ethiopian Highlands. The study applies the Theory of Planned
Behavior theoretical framework, as well as the Ordered Probit model and
Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to model
farmers' adoption decisions. The results show that socioeconomic factors
such as access to agricultural loans and off-farm income, household
labor availability and livestock ownership increase the probability of
adopting two or more SAPs. The results further show that farmers'
intentions and personal norms significantly influence the number of SAPs
adopted at farm-level. These results imply that efforts to promote the
widespread adoption of SAPs by smallholder farmers should focus on
enhancing farmers' access to agricultural loans and off-farm income,
through increased integration into the non-farm rural economy and
addressing liquidity constraints through affordable rural financing
schemes. The adoption of SAPs can further be enhanced by raising
farmers' general awareness and knowledge to change their perceptions and
attitudes towards sustainable farming practices.},

	abstract = {PLS-regression (PLSR) is the PLS approach in its simplest, and in chemistry and technology, most used form (two-block predictive PLS). PLSR is a method for relating two data matrices, X and Y, by a linear multivariate model, but goes beyond traditional regression in that it models also the structure of X and Y. PLSR derives its usefulness from its ability to analyze data with many, noisy, collinear, and even incomplete variables in both X and Y. PLSR has the desirable property that the precision of the model parameters improves with the increasing number of relevant variables and observations. This article reviews PLSR as it has developed to become a standard tool in chemometrics and used in chemistry and engineering. The underlying model and its assumptions are discussed, and commonly used diagnostics are reviewed together with the interpretation of resulting parameters. Two examples are used as illustrations: First, a Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship (QSAR)/Quantitative Structure–Property Relationship (QSPR) data set of peptides is used to outline how to develop, interpret and refine a PLSR model. Second, a data set from the manufacturing of recycled paper is analyzed to illustrate time series modelling of process data by means of PLSR and time-lagged X-variables.},
