	abstract = {The adoption of Sustainable Agricultural Practices (SAPs) remains high
on the policy and research agenda in most of sub-Saharan Africa. This
paper adopts an integrative approach to investigate how psycho-social
and socioeconomic factors influence the uptake of SAPs by smallholder
farmers in Ethiopian Highlands. The study applies the Theory of Planned
Behavior theoretical framework, as well as the Ordered Probit model and
Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to model
farmers' adoption decisions. The results show that socioeconomic factors
such as access to agricultural loans and off-farm income, household
labor availability and livestock ownership increase the probability of
adopting two or more SAPs. The results further show that farmers'
intentions and personal norms significantly influence the number of SAPs
adopted at farm-level. These results imply that efforts to promote the
widespread adoption of SAPs by smallholder farmers should focus on
enhancing farmers' access to agricultural loans and off-farm income,
through increased integration into the non-farm rural economy and
addressing liquidity constraints through affordable rural financing
schemes. The adoption of SAPs can further be enhanced by raising
farmers' general awareness and knowledge to change their perceptions and
attitudes towards sustainable farming practices.},
