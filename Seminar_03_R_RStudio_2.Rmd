## Seminar 3: Using R and RStudio continued

This tutorial walks through the process of loading and working with R. 
Some of the steps (loading R and RStudio) should already be familiar to you. If not then please also follow those. If you already have R and RStudio loaded then you should be able to follow the wrangling and visualization sections of this tutorial.
