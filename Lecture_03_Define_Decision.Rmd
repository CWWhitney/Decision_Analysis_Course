The following videos cover some of the challenges that researchers and agricultural development experts face when attempting to define decisions. Please watch the videos and answer the questions that follow.

<!-- Think about the following questions and jot down your thoughts. -->

<!-- - **Does decision analysis make sense without involving a decision-maker?** -->
<!-- - **What can this achieve, and what shouldn't we expect from it?** -->

### Quality Decision Making

This video outlines the background for quality decision making, closely following @howard_foundations_2015. At the end of the video please take some time to sketch out some thoughts about a decision that you will be working on for the experiential part of this course. You can find the slides for the first three parts of the lecture here.

- **Define the decision-maker**: The person, organization or group that will be faced with choices. 
- **Define the  decision choice and alternatives**: from which to choose
- **Define the preferences**: clarify how the decision-makers consider the different possible consequences and outcomes of the decision. These can take many forms, i.e. they can be personal, societal or cultural values.
- **Define the sources of Information**: What sources of information will you access to gather a causal understanding of the decision impact pathway. Be explicit about where you will reach out, i.e. specific farmers, literature etc.

```{r question-quality-decision, echo=FALSE}
question("The criteria for decision quality include:",
  answer("Large datasets with empirical evidence and measurements of expected outcomes."),
  answer("Preferences about decision outcomes.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Certainty about what the decision outcome will be."),
 answer("Clear framing of decision alternatives.", correct = TRUE),
  incorrect = "Watch [the video](https://youtu.be/r_BbXfMbfe0) and try again.",
allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### Group discussion reading: 

This week you will all read @howard_foundations_2015 (Chapter 1. Introduction to Quality Decision Making). One group will lead a discussion on the reading.

```{r question-howard, echo=FALSE}
question("According to the Howard and Abbas reading, which of the following represents a decision?",
  answer("I have decided that I do not like vanilla ice cream."),
  answer("I have decided that the stock market will go up."),
  answer("I have decided to ace the test."),
 answer("I have decided to diet, and I have thrown away the ice cream in the freezer.", correct = TRUE),
  incorrect = "Look at page 31 'What is a Decision' and try again.",
allow_retry = TRUE
)
```
