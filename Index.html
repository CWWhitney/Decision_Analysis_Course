<p>Welcome to <strong>Decision Analysis and Forecasting for Agricultural Development</strong>. We are excited to deliver you this course content and to train a new generation of experts in applying these tools. We see enormous scope for application of these methods in agriculture and the need for more practitioners.</p>
<p>Decisions in agriculture are often risky, meaning that decision makers have uncertainty about how their decision will influence the intended outcomes. Farming systems are dynamic and the impact of any intervention, policy or management decision is likely to be influenced by many factors ranging from soil and crop dynamics to social dynamics such as farmer and community perceptions. In order to provide scientific support for decision making it is important that our models and forecasts attempt to include these interactions. Decision Analysis provides a set of approaches that are aimed at capturing what is known and applying this knowledge to generate forecasts of decision outcomes. The theoretical body of approaches have been formally applied in business and economics for more than 50 years <span class="citation">Howard and Abbas (2015)</span> and have been gaining ground in agricultural development research more recently <span class="citation">Luedeling and Shepherd (2016)</span>. Our mission is to normalize these holistic approaches and move agricultural science from the lab bench and field trials to real world application and decision support for farmers and agricultural decision makers such as those in government ministries and aid organizations.</p>
<p><strong>A student is not a vessel to be filled, but a lamp to be lighted…</strong> - Plutarch</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>What?</strong> This is an experiential course. You (students) will be leading discussions and projects.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>So What?</strong> The aim is for you to become a critical thinker and lead the process in generating useful forecasts for decision makers in agricultural development.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Now What?</strong> You will build a working model of an agricultural development decision.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-course-content" class="section level2">
<h2>Course content</h2>
<p>In this course, we will provide an overview of methods we can use to study agricultural development decisions and generate forecasts of decision outcomes. If you do not have a clear idea what that is you’ve come to the right place. This course was developed for MSc. students in <a href="https://www.lf.uni-bonn.de/en/studying/master/npw">Crop Sciences</a> at the <a href="https://www.uni-bonn.de/startpage?set_language=en">University of Bonn</a>, but the materials are also intended for a general audience interested in applying these tools. The main parts of the course include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#section-decision_analysis">Introduction to Decision Analysis</a></li>
<li><a href="#section-biases">Forecasting and cognitive biases</a></li>
<li><a href="#section-calibration">Calibration training</a></li>
<li><a href="#section-participatory_methods">Participatory modeling building</a></li>
<li><a href="#section-model_programming">Decision modeling in R</a></li>
<li>Group project on decision analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>See the official pages in the coursebook here <a href="https://www.lf.uni-bonn.de/en/studying/downloads/coursebook2020/module-msc-npw2020"><strong>Decision Analysis and Forecasting for Agricultural Development</strong></a>.</p>
<p>After some introduction of the subject matter much of this course will consist of practical application of the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/decisionSupport/index.html"><code>decisionSupport</code></a> package in the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> programming language <span class="citation">(R Core Team 2021)</span>.</p>
<div id="section-intended-learning-outcomes" class="section level3">
<h3>Intended learning outcomes</h3>
<p>In this course, we aim to provide you with the skills and experiences in decision modeling. By the end of this course you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>develop decision models and comprehensively evaluate the findings using the <code>R</code> programming language with functions from the <code>decisionSupport</code> package <span class="citation">(Luedeling et al. 2021)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>recognize your own biases and provide accurate range estimates for uncertain variables.</p></li>
<li><p>analyze a decision context. You will be able to draw conclusions from a decision model and recommend steps forward.</p></li>
<li><p>develop decision models, comprehensively evaluate your findings and compose a report about the model you developed.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-performance-assessment" class="section level2">
<h2>Performance assessment</h2>
<p>In this module, there will be no exam, but you’ll still have to put in a bit of effort to pass and get a good grade here. Over the course of the semester, you’ll be developing an <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">Rmarkdown</a> document, where you’ll record your learning and your coding work (<a href="http://inresgb-lehre.iaas.uni-bonn.de/Methodology_outline.html">here is an example from Hoa Do with an overview that includes the main modeling procedures with the decisionSupport package in R</a>) <span class="citation">(Luedeling et al. 2021)</span>. This document will contain short thematic chapters on the lecture contents, as well as the code you’ll produce and the outputs you’ll generate. The final chapters will contain some discussion of the results you’ll have obtained. This document will be evaluated, and it will be the major determinant of your final grade (participation in class will also count for some of the grade).</p>
<p>There will be about 60 hours of formal in-class time (15 ~ 4 hour <a href="#section-lecture_schedule">lectures</a> and <a href="#section-seminar_schedule">seminars</a>) and 120 hours of work outside the class.</p>
<div id="section-what-we-expect-from-you" class="section level3">
<h3>What we expect from you</h3>
<p>Class participation will be about 50% of the work in this course. We will expect you to show up in class and be an active participant in discussions. We may also have short weekly tests for seeing how up to speed you are and we will track your project activity (follow your <a href="github.com">git</a> repositories etc.).</p>
<p>Group work will make up the rest of the required work for this course. You will put together a report, build a repository with code and a working RMarkdown file. You will also do weekly reading/listening assignments and lead short related discussions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-house-rules" class="section level2">
<h2>House rules</h2>
<p>In this course, we’ll gradually work our way into the <code>decisionSupport</code> package <span class="citation">(Luedeling et al. 2021)</span>. At the end of the semester, you should be able to apply state-of-the-art Decision Analysis. Yet even if it’s not your ambition to become a decision analyst, you’ll have picked up a bunch of useful skills along the way. We’ll try to teach you how to use some staple programming tools and techniques that can be used for all kinds of programming challenges. These will include the use of git and <a href="github.com">github</a> and <a href="rmarkdown.com">Rmarkdown</a>, as well the the ability to create, manipulate and use R functions and packages.</p>
<p>What is expected of you is to be engaged in this class, and to diligently complete the assignments you receive. Learning things in R requires practice, through which many things that seem cumbersome at first eventually become almost automatic. We are hopeful that the things you’ll get exposed to in this class will be assets in your scientific (or other) career. So please take the materials seriously!</p>
<p>This course not only aims to teach you things about Decision Analysis and related topics - it also provides hands-on exercises to illustrate the functions of the <code>decisionSupport</code> package <span class="citation">Luedeling et al. (2021)</span>. For all of these practical components, we need tools. <code>decisionSupport</code> is an R package, so we’ll need <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, which is most comfortably operated through the <a href="https://rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> interface.</p>
<p>We could simply start running <a href="https://rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> on our local computer, save our files somewhere on our hard drive and generally operate the way we usually work with our computer. But this is not how real programmers work, and since this is what we’re trying to be, we should familiarize ourselves with some code development tools that such people use. We’ll therefore introduce you to <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> and <a href="https://github.com/">github</a>, which are very useful for keeping code organized and secure and for sharing with collaborators and wider audiences.</p>
<p>Finally, we want to show you how to properly document what you do in R, and how to compile professional-looking reports of your work. This is what <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">Rmarkdown</a> helps us do. Some of this may be a bit confusing in the beginning, but you’ll probably learn to appreciate the value of these tools, as we keep using them in this module.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-group-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Group Work</h2>
<p>The course will be largely based on group work. Please take some time to choose a group to work with and begin to think about a decision. Over the next few weeks you will be responsible for the following milestones:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Identify a decision</p></li>
<li><p>Collaborate with decision makers on decision model development (qualitative)</p></li>
<li><p>Generate model code from qualitative model and parameterize (quantitative step)</p></li>
<li><p>Generate a git repo with code and documentation</p></li>
<li><p>Write a ~ 5,000 word paper in RMarkdown, see this report on <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/hortibonn/Plotting-High-Dimensional-Data/blob/master/HighDimensionalData.html">plotting high-dimensional data</a> for a useful example of how this can be done.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, each week small teams (groups of two or three) will be responsible for presenting and leading a discussion on a short paper or chapter. We expect everyone in the course to read the work and come prepared for the meeting. Please contact us if you cannot find the readings in the library or elsewhere. We will help you get a copy.</p>

<h2>Seminar 1: Group Work Overview</h2>
<!-- use the {#tools} syntax to create a label that can be referenced with [Group Work Overview](#tools) -->
<p>Welcome to the first seminar of <strong>Decision Analysis and Forecasting for Agricultural Development</strong>.</p>
<p>You should already be familiar with the idea that we intend to have group work form a major part of this course. If you have not already it is important that you choose a group to work with and begin to think about a topic (ideally an agricultural decision) that you intend to work on through this course. In this seminar we will share the general motivation behind the experiential nature of this course and talk about effective group work techniques and tools. The lecture in week three <a href="#section-define_decision">Defining a decision</a> will provide a detailed exploration of how decisions are defined / steps we may need to go through to help decision makers define decisions.</p>
<p>Feel free to bring up any questions or concerns in the Slack or to <a href="mailto:cory.whitney@uni-bonn.de?subject=%5BSeminar_4%5D%20Decision%20Analysis%20Lecture">Dr. Cory Whitney</a> or the course tutor.</p>
<p>To see an example of the result we will be aiming to create see the paper by <span class="citation">Do, Luedeling, and Whitney (2020)</span> and the associated <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3727576">supplementary materials</a>.</p>
<p>The first step in getting ready for the work of this course is to install and run <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> <span class="citation">(R Core Team 2021)</span> and <a href="https://rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>.</p>

<p>Welcome to lecture 2 of <strong>Decision Analysis and Forecasting for Agricultural Development</strong>. In this lecture we will follow a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe1C9W5AtEiBzmXFf-XzmXH8NNJjqs0IY">six-part micro-series of videos</a> and use the <code>#lecture-02-overview</code> Slack channel and Zoom meeting to follow up. This will allow us all to have a chance to see your progress, provide feedback. It will be encouraging to others to see activity from colleagues. Feel free to bring up any questions or concerns in the Slack or to <a href="mailto:cory.whitney@uni-bonn.de?subject=%5BSeminar_2%5D%20Decision%20Analysis%20Lecture">Dr. Cory Whitney</a> or the course tutor.</p>
<p>Please take a few minutes to watch these six short videos and do the associated exercises before our meeting.</p>
<div id="section-introduction-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The introduction outlines the general theory and application of Decision Analysis tools. <strong>At the end of the video please take a moment to think about decisions that are made in agricultural development</strong>, ideally decisions that are relevant to your research interests. Please share these with us in the Slack channel.</p>
<p><strong>Remember to take a moment to gather your thoughts so far and share with us in Slack. </strong></p>

<h3>Part 1: Approaches</h3>
<p>Part 1 gives an overview of various approaches in agricultural research and of the Decision Analysis paradigm. At the end of the video please take a moment to think about a situation where Decision Analysis might be applicable. Try and identify a decision maker with a choice between different options and with uncertainty about the outcome.</p>

<p>This video outlines the background for quality decision making, closely following <span class="citation">Howard and Abbas (2015)</span>. At the end of the video please take some time to sketch out some thoughts about a decision that you will be working on for the experiential part of this course. You can find the slides for the first three parts of the lecture here.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Define the decision-maker</strong>: The person, organization or group that will be faced with choices.</li>
<li><strong>Define the decision choice and alternatives</strong>: from which to choose</li>
<li><strong>Define the preferences</strong>: clarify how the decision-makers consider the different possible consequences and outcomes of the decision. These can take many forms, i.e. they can be personal, societal or cultural values.</li>
<li><strong>Define the sources of Information</strong>: What sources of information will you access to gather a causal understanding of the decision impact pathway. Be explicit about where you will reach out, i.e. specific farmers, literature etc.</li>

<h3>Using RMarkdown</h3>
<p>RMarkdown: overview</p>
<p><img src="images/RMarkdown.png" style="width:2in" /></p>
<p>Now let’s check out <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">Rmarkdown</a>, a powerful tool that allows making fancy reports, websites etc. out of our R code. You’re already looking at an example, by the way. This website was produced with Rmarkdown (and it wasn’t hard at all)!</p>

<p>Here are <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/CWWhitney/teaching_R//blob/master/RMarkdown/RMarkdown.html">the slides</a> and <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/CWWhitney/teaching_R//blob/master/RMarkdown/RMarkdown_example.html">the html file</a> generated in the video.</p>
<p>To run this you will need to load <code>library(rmarkdown)</code></p>
<p><img src="images/hex-rmarkdown.png" style="width:1in" /></p>
<p>and library(<code>knitr</code>)</p>
<p><img src="images/knitrhex.png" style="width:1in" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Use <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">RMarkdown</a>!</li>
<li>You will thank yourself</li>
<li>Save often with new version (or use git)</li>
</ul>

<h3>RMarkdown: getting stuck</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use a ‘?’ with function, package, data name in the R console</li>
<li>If you get stuck, use Google: just add “R” to a search e.g. a copy of an error message</li>
<li>Someone else has also been confused by it and has written about it</li>
<li>Thousands of talented programmers scan the web and answer these problems</li>

<h2>Seminar 5: Using git and Github</h2>
<!-- [Using git and Github](#github_git) -->
<p>Welcome to the fourth seminar of <strong>Decision Analysis and Forecasting for Agricultural Development</strong>. All your programming and project work for this course should take place in the git environment and this seminar is intended to show you how to make that happen. Feel free to bring up any questions or concerns in the Slack or to <a href="mailto:cory.whitney@uni-bonn.de?subject=%5BSeminar_4%5D%20Decision%20Analysis%20Lecture">Dr. Cory Whitney</a> or the course tutor.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-git-and-github" class="section level2">
<h2>git and Github</h2>
<p>Now we look at the programming version control environment <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> and the interface <a href="https://github.com/">github</a>, which we use to share our scripts and changes to our work.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S98XJTyIVaY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p>Install Git &amp; join Github (if you have not already):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>install Git <small><a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" class="uri">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a></small></p></li>
<li><p>join Github <small><a href="https://github.com/" class="uri">https://github.com/</a></small></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Some useful tips on getting these running from our friends</p>

</ul>
<p>Start simple with your own repository only and work on it alone. Soon you will start to collaborate on something in git. For the project part of this course your team will work in a collective repository and work together to generate the final working project model and report.</p>
<div id="section-sharing-html-files" class="section level3">
<h3>Sharing html files</h3>
<p>We can use the options from <code>htmlpreview.github.io</code> to show the results of any of our html output work that is stored in our git repository.</p>
<p>To do that just preface the path for the html file with <code>http://htmlpreview.github.io/?</code>.</p>
<p>For example the slides for this seminar can be found in the <code>CWWhitney/teaching_git</code> repository.</p>
<p>The full path is: <code>https://github.com/CWWhitney/teaching_git/blob/master/R_Git_GitHub.html</code></p>
