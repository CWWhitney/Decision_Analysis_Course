<p>Welcome to <strong>Decision Analysis and Forecasting for Agricultural
Development</strong>. We are excited to deliver you this course content
and to train a new generation of experts in applying these tools. We see
enormous scope for application of these methods in agriculture and the
need for more practitioners. The course has a <a
href="https://agtools.app/decision_analysis/">dedicated interactive
website</a> but if you prefer you can also look at the <a
href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/CWWhitney/Decision_Analysis_Course/blob/main/Index.html">simple
html version</a>.</p>
<p>Decisions in agriculture are often risky, meaning that decision
makers have uncertainty about how their decision will influence the
intended outcomes. Farming systems are dynamic and the impact of any
intervention, policy or management decision is likely to be influenced
by many factors ranging from soil and crop dynamics to social dynamics
such as farmer and community perceptions. In order to provide scientific
support for decision making it is important that our models and
forecasts attempt to include these interactions. Decision Analysis
provides a set of approaches that are aimed at capturing what is known
and applying this knowledge to generate forecasts of decision outcomes.
The theoretical body of approaches have been formally applied in
business and economics for more than 50 years <span
class="citation">Howard and Abbas (2015)</span> and have been gaining
ground in agricultural development research more recently <span
class="citation">Luedeling and Shepherd (2016)</span>. Our mission is to
normalize these holistic approaches and move agricultural science from
the lab bench and field trials to real world application and decision
support for farmers and agricultural decision makers such as those in
government ministries and aid organizations.</p>

<h2>Course content</h2>
<p>In this course, we will provide an overview of methods we can use to
study agricultural development decisions and generate forecasts of
decision outcomes. If you do not have a clear idea what that is you’ve
come to the right place. This course was developed for MSc. students in
<a
href="https://www.aei.uni-bonn.de/en/studies/study-programs/msc-crop-sciences/msc-npw">Crop
Sciences</a> at the <a href="https://www.uni-bonn.de/en/home">University
of Bonn</a>, but the materials are also intended for a general audience
interested in applying these tools. The main parts of the course
include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#section-decision_analysis">Introduction to Decision
Analysis</a></li>
<li><a href="#section-calibration_lecture">Calibration training</a></li>
<li><a href="#section-participatory_methods">Participatory modeling
building</a></li>
<li><a href="#section-model_programming">Decision modeling in R</a></li>
<li>Group project on decision analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>See the official pages in the coursebook here <a
href="https://www.aei.uni-bonn.de/de/studium/medienpdf/modulhandbuch/mhb-msc-arts.pdf#page=72.08"><strong>Decision
Analysis and Forecasting for Agricultural Development</strong></a>.</p>
<p>After some introduction of the subject matter much of this course
will consist of practical application of the <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/decisionSupport/index.html"><code>decisionSupport</code></a>
package in the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> programming
language <span class="citation">(R Core Team 2024)</span>.</p>
<div id="section-intended-learning-outcomes" class="section level3">
<h3>Intended learning outcomes</h3>
<p>In this course, we aim to provide you with the skills and experiences
in decision modeling. By the end of this course you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>develop decision models and comprehensively evaluate the findings
using the <code>R</code> programming language with functions from the
<code>decisionSupport</code> package <span class="citation">(Luedeling
et al. 2024)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>recognize your own biases and provide accurate range estimates
for uncertain variables.</p></li>
<li><p>analyze a decision context. You will be able to draw conclusions
from a decision model and recommend steps forward.</p></li>
<li><p>develop decision models, comprehensively evaluate your findings
and compose a report about the model you developed.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-performance-assessment" class="section level2">
<h2>Performance assessment</h2>
<p>In this module, there will be no exam, but you’ll still have to put
in a bit of effort to pass and get a good grade here. Over the course of
the semester, you’ll be developing an <a
href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">Rmarkdown</a> document, where
you’ll record your learning and your coding work (<a
href="http://inresgb-lehre.iaas.uni-bonn.de/Methodology_outline.html">here
is an example from Hoa Do with an overview that includes the main
modeling procedures with the decisionSupport package in R</a>) <span
class="citation">(Luedeling et al. 2024)</span>. This document will
contain short thematic chapters on the lecture contents, as well as the
code you’ll produce and the outputs you’ll generate. The final chapters
will contain some discussion of the results you’ll have obtained. This
document will be evaluated, and it will be the major determinant of your
final grade (participation in class will also count for some of the
grade).</p>
<p>There will be about 60 hours of formal in-class time (15 ~ 4 hour <a
href="#section-lecture_schedule">lectures</a> and <a
href="#section-seminar_schedule">seminars</a>) and 120 hours of work
outside the class.</p>
<div id="section-what-we-expect-from-you" class="section level3">
<h3>What we expect from you</h3>
<p>Class participation will be about 50% of the work in this course. We
will expect you to show up in class and be an active participant in
discussions. We may also have short weekly tests for seeing how up to
speed you are and we will track your project activity (follow your <a
href="github.com">git</a> repositories etc.).</p>
<p>Group work will make up the rest of the required work for this
course. You will put together a report, build a repository with code and
a working RMarkdown file. You will also do weekly reading/listening
assignments and lead short related discussions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-house-rules" class="section level2">
<h2>House rules</h2>
<p>In this course, we’ll gradually work our way into the
<code>decisionSupport</code> package <span class="citation">(Luedeling
et al. 2024)</span>. At the end of the semester, you should be able to
apply state-of-the-art Decision Analysis. Yet even if it’s not your
ambition to become a decision analyst, you’ll have picked up a bunch of
useful skills along the way. We’ll try to teach you how to use some
staple programming tools and techniques that can be used for all kinds
of programming challenges. These will include the use of git and <a
href="github.com">github</a> and <a href="rmarkdown.com">Rmarkdown</a>,
as well the the ability to create, manipulate and use R functions and
packages.</p>
<p>What is expected of you is to be engaged in this class, and to
diligently complete the assignments you receive. Learning things in R
requires practice, through which many things that seem cumbersome at
first eventually become almost automatic. We are hopeful that the things
you’ll get exposed to in this class will be assets in your scientific
(or other) career. So please take the materials seriously!</p>
<p>This course not only aims to teach you things about Decision Analysis
and related topics - it also provides hands-on exercises to illustrate
the functions of the <code>decisionSupport</code> package <span
class="citation">Luedeling et al. (2024)</span>. For all of these
practical components, we need tools. <code>decisionSupport</code> is an
R package, so we’ll need <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>,
which we will operate through the <a
href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/">RStudio</a>
interface.</p>
<p>We could simply start running <a
href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/">RStudio</a> on our
local computer, save our files somewhere on our hard drive and generally
operate the way we usually work with our computer. But this is not how
real programmers work, and since this is what we’re trying to be, we
should familiarize ourselves with some code development tools that such
people use. We’ll therefore introduce you to <a
href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> and <a
href="https://github.com/">github</a>, which are very useful for keeping
code organized and secure and for sharing with collaborators and wider
audiences.</p>
<p>Finally, we want to show you how to properly document what you do in
R, and how to compile professional-looking reports of your work. This is
what <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">Rmarkdown</a> helps us do.
Some of this may be a bit confusing in the beginning, but you’ll
probably learn to appreciate the value of these tools, as we keep using
them in this module.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-group-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Group Work</h2>
<p>The course will be largely based on group work. Please take some time
to choose a group to work with and begin to think about a decision. Over
the next few weeks you will be responsible for the following
milestones:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Identify a decision</p></li>
<li><p>Identify and frame a decision and develop a qualitative
model</p></li>
<li><p>Generate quantitative model from your qualitative model and
parameterize</p></li>
<li><p>Generate a git repo with code and documentation</p></li>
<li><p>Write a ~ 5,000 word paper in RMarkdown, see this report on <a
href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/hortibonn/Plotting-High-Dimensional-Data/blob/master/HighDimensionalData.html">plotting
high-dimensional data</a> for a useful example of how this can be
done.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, each week small teams (groups of two or three) will be
responsible for presenting and leading a discussion on a short paper or
chapter. We expect everyone in the course to read the work and come
prepared for the meeting. Please contact us if you cannot find the
readings in the library or elsewhere. We will help you get a copy.</p>
