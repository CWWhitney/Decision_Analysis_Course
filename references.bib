This is due to a variety of factors including lack of data, complex impact pathways and risks and uncertainties that are difficult to factor into intervention planning. Scientific approaches to produce reliable impact projections are rarely applied in agricultural development, but Decision Analysis techniques commonly used in other fields have the potential to improve development decisions. This working paper outlines a Decision Analysis approach that can help decision makers efficiently allocate resources to enhance the effectiveness of policy decisions.},

	abstract = {The mountainous northwest of Vietnam is home for the majority of the country’s ethnic minorities. Poverty and food insecurity are common in the region, increasing population and land scarcity have induced the expansion of agricultural areas and consequent decline of land productivity due to soil erosion and land degradation. Local farmers have begun to practice agroforestry through the introduction of high value trees into traditional cropping systems with various combinations of timber, fruit, nut forage trees and annual crops. However, because of inherent production risks and many remaining uncertainties, assessing the long-term performance of agroforestry has remained challenging. We simulated prospective system benefits of agroforestry options by developing comprehensive and holistic models that aimed to explicitly consider all relevant risks and uncertainties. The initial findings reveal model components such as drought and frost and potential extreme weather events as the primary risks to agroforestry in the region. The analysis approach is a promising tool for ex-ante assessments of other planned interventions.},

	abstract = {Deciduous fruit trees require adequate cold winter temperatures to overcome dormancy and to maintain their productivity. In the future this chill requirement may not be met in Chilean fruit tree production systems, which will experience warmer winters due to climate change. To study the impact of climate change on Chilean agriculture, we selected eight sites of agricultural interest in the north (Ovalle, Quillota) the central regions (Rengo, Curicó, Talca) and in the south (Chillán, Temuco and Osorno). Winter chill availability was estimated for the past and the future by using 15 different climate model projections. A weather station was selected for each site with minimum and maximum temperature records from 1967 to 2017. Using these records for calibration, synthetic temperatures for 2000 to 2100 were projected for two different scenarios of Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) of 4.5 and 8.5. Winter chill availability, safe winter chill and the number of spring frost events were projected for reference years 2050 (for the period 2035 – 2065) and 2085 (for the period 2070 – 2100). Results show a dramatic reduction of winter chill in the northern regions by 2085 in the RCP8.5 scenario. Central regions could lose as much as 70 chill portions by 2085. No major impacts were found in southern regions. Spring frost events across the country decreased with increase in years and RCP scenario. Climate change will affect future fruit production in Chile, in northern regions the minimum chill requirement of some species may only be achieved if mitigation strategies are implemented.

	copyright = {All rights reserved},
	abstract = {Decision analysis tools can help to utilise available data and expert knowledge rather than requiring hard data from costly long-term fieldwork and experiments. They allow for the incorporation of disparate data sources and what might be considered 'imprecise' inputs to create a representation of the current understanding of cause and effect relationships within the target system. Such tools were applied to provide evidence-based support for policy decisions regarding planting varieties of mango (Mangifera indica L.) and avocado (Persea americana Mill.) trees in Kenya. A group of twenty experts, including representatives of government and non-government organisations, agricultural technicians and practitioners, academics and analysts, collaboratively modeled the potential livelihood impacts of planting fruit trees on smallholder farms in Kenya. The critical determinants of the effectiveness of these trees for household nutrition were established. Estimations on variables and relationships were generated from expert knowledge and available data. These were used to programme four comprehensive Bayesian Network models of around 60 variables each to show the difference in the annual dietary gap in terms of estimated average requirement of energy, iron, provitamin A and zinc per person in smallholder households. Model results indicate that planting fruit trees can benefit the nutritional status of households, decreasing risks of hunger and micronutrient deficiency. The results show substantial differences in potential nutrition outcomes between planting vs. not planting fruit trees. Overall the results suggest that planting fruit trees may result in a lower per person dietary gap for provitamin A (median 58,871 vs. 204,060 mcg retinol activity equi-valents/yr), iron (-332 vs. 759 mg /yr), zinc (1,424 vs. 2,299 mg /yr), and energy (341,070 vs. 364,270 kcal /yr). Results can be used to inform policies related to fruit tree planting and to plan for potential outcomes of development actions in Kenya.},

	abstract = {Southwestern Uganda’s population density, 64 people per square kilometer, is less than half of the national average, however a high growth rate and low average age are likely to exacerbate land scarcity, poverty (per capita GDP 500 USD), and food insecurity. The region is ideal for farming, with fertile soils, 1500–2000 mm annual rainfall, and mean annual temperature range of 12.5–30◦C. Uganda’s agricultural authorities aim to utilise this strength and industrialise farming systems away from the common traditional homegardens, currently the source of most food. However, robust science-based information to support this decision is lacking. Here we used decision analysis methods for probabilistic simulations of food nutritional implications based on homegardens and the proposed changes.
We compared total nutrient outputs of two scenarios: 1) 102 homegardens (HG) multilayered diverse banana plantations intercropped with fruits and vegetables, based on extensive field work; 2) Ugandan agricultural authority plans (UA) dominated by grains, tubers, Tooke bananas, and legumes. Land area for food production in HG was around 95\%, whereas, UA used 100\% by removing homes and roads, or as little as 75\% with area lost to commercial non-food products. Yield estimates were based on HG observed yields and reports with UA yield increases of 5–60 \% with chemical fertilisers. Crops were categorised by food group with nutrient contribution based on yields.
Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 model runs revealed that, while industrialising farming systems may be a win in terms of energy and some nutrients, homegardens should nevertheless be maintained for key important nutrients. UA significantly outperformed HG in protein production by 50 \%, calories, carbohydrates, thiamine and zinc by 40 \%, fiber by 30 \%, thiamin by 20 \%, and folates by 13 \%. HG significantly outperformed UA in production of vitamin-C by 170 \%, calcium 60\%, riboflavin 40\%, vitamin-A 30\%, beta-carotene and vitamin B6 20\%, total lipids 2\%, and iron and niacin by 10 \%. HG also had folic acid and vitamin B12 whereas UA had none.
Partial least-squares regression of Monte Carlo output indicated that gathering more data on the annual yields of roots and tubers would most improve certainty about the nutrition contribution of HG and UA scenarios.},

	abstract = {The Greater Bushenyi region in southwest Uganda is characterized by high ecological and cultural diversity, but also by high levels of poverty and malnutrition. Much of the natural vegetation (Guineo-Congolian rainforest) has been transformed into banana-based homegardens (HG), the primary source of food for local people. Inventories of 102 HGs aimed to define HG types in relation to their level of agrobiodiversity as a first step in conceptualizing interventions to help address regional food insecurity.   Ward's minimum variance hierarchical cluster analysis, (with Mahalanobis distance measure and squared Euclidean distances of log(e) transformed individual densities of useful plant species per 1000 m2 HG area) divided HGs into four distinct HG floristic diversity types. Clusters 1 (n=39 HGs) and 2 (n=10) had the greatest Shannon H’ and greatest Pielou’s J’. Cluster-3 (n=10) had the highest species richness, but only medium H’ and J’. Cluster-4 (n=43) had the greatest abundance and richness of annual and perennial herbs. Clusters 3 and 4 both had the greatest abundance and density of plants per 1,000 m2. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) revealed 98\% correct classification and a Breiman's random forest model explained 51\% of variance. Models of the cluster assignment and plant species densities indicated 13 plant species important to the clustering model. Mean squared error (MSE) values in the random forests model were strongest for eight species Phaseoulus vulgaris, Coffea arabica, Amaranthus dubius, Amaranthus hybridus, Saccharum officinarum, Amaranthus spinosus, Solanum torvum, and Artocarpus heterophyllus (MSE{\textless}1.3\%). Stepwise variable selection indicated 11 species significantly minimizing the Wilk's λ; A. spinosus, P. vulgaris, C. arabica, A. hybridus, S. torvum, Gynandropsis gynandra, Hibiscus acetosella, Gynura scandens, Grevillea robusta, A. dubius, and Antiaris toxicaria (p{\textless}0.001).   Increasing the nutritional value of these food systems may begin with a diverse approach based on the identified HG types and important plants.},

We generated and analysed thousands of ecosystem population time series to investigate whether ﬁtted models can aid decision-makers to select interventions. Using these time-series data (sparse and noisy datasets drawn from deterministic Lotka-Volterra systems with two to nine species, of known network structure), dynamic model forecasts of whether a species’ future population will be positively or negatively affected by rapid eradication of another species were correct {\textgreater} 70\% of the time. Although 70\% correct classiﬁcations is only slightly better than an uninformative prediction (50\%), this classiﬁcation accuracy can be feasibly improved by increasing monitoring accuracy and frequency.

The advice from statisticians for scientists employing multimodel inference is to develop a well-thought-out set of candidate models for comparison, though precise instructions for how to do that are typically not given. A coherent body of knowledge, which falls under the general term causal analysis, now exists for examining the explanatory scientific content of candidate models. Much of the literature on causal analysis has been recently developed, and we suspect may not be familiar to many ecologists. This body of knowledge comprises a set of graphical tools and axiomatic principles to support scientists in their endeavors to create “well-formed hypotheses,” as statisticians are asking them to do. Causal analysis is complementary to methods such as structural equation modeling, which provides the means for evaluation of proposed hypotheses against data. In this paper, we summarize and illustrate a set of principles that can guide scientists in their quest to develop explanatory hypotheses for evaluation. The principles presented in this paper have the capacity to close the communication gap between statisticians, who urge scientists to develop wellthought-out coherent models, and scientists, who would like some practical advice for exactly how to do that.},

	abstract = {In the arid areas of Sub-Saharan Africa, perennial challenges of water scarcity and food insecurity are exacerbated by climate change and variability. The development of robust strategies to cope with the region's climatic challenges requires thorough consideration of uncertainty and risk in decision making. We demonstrate the use of probabilistic decision analysis to compare intervention options to prevent reservoir sedimentation in Burkina Faso. To illustrate this approach, we developed a causal impact pathway model based on the local knowledge of expert stakeholders. Input parameters were described by probability distributions derived from estimated conﬁdence intervals. The model was run in a Monte Carlo simulation to generate the range of plausible decision outcomes, quantiﬁed as the net present value and the annual cash ﬂow. We used Partial Least Squares regression analysis to identify the parameters that most aﬀected projected intervention outcomes and we computed the Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) to highlight critical uncertainties. Numerical results show that the preferred intervention to secure agricultural production is a combination of dredging, rock dams and a buﬀer scheme around the reservoir. The EVPI calculation reveals an information value for the proﬁt per ton of vegetables, indicating that more information on this variable would be useful for supporting the decision. However, without the need for follow-up analysis, the results show high probability of beneﬁts given the combined interventions, which, given the current state of information, should be preferred over inaction.},

	abstract = {Decision-making in development rarely considers uncertainty in project beneﬁts and costs and the risk of project failure. Lack of appropriate tools for ex-ante analysis under conditions of data scarcity constrains the ability of decision-makers to anticipate project outcomes. Business analysis techniques can help in such situations, but they have rarely been applied in development contexts. We use the principles of Applied Information Economics to develop a decision model for a water supply intervention. In the proposed Habaswein-Wajir Water Supply Project in Northern Kenya, water is to be extracted from a major aquifer near Habaswein and piped to the city of Wajir. A team of eight experts developed a model including all costs, beneﬁts, and risks considered important for project success. After estimation training, these experts expressed their uncertainty for about 100 variables in the model with probability distributions. We used Monte Carlo simulation to project decision outcomes, and Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression to identify critical uncertainties affecting the decision. The project was found to be risky for most stakeholders, mainly due to the risk of political interference caused by water supply concerns in Habaswein and due to unclear proﬁtability of the water supply business. Uncertainties about how to value decreasing infant mortality and reduction in water-borne disease incidence were also critical. The greatest hydrological risk was salt water intrusion into the aquifer. Careful well design, inclusive project planning and beneﬁt sharing could raise the chance of project success. The analysis improved understanding of the decision by all stakeholders, some of which changed their opinions on the pipeline, requested more measurements, or proposed alternative water supply options. Decision analysis can help clarify decision uncertainties and outcome expectations and thereby improve decision-making processes, especially in data-scarce areas.},

The decisionSupport() function in the R package decisionSupport can be applied to conduct decision analysis.

	abstract = {Engagement with farmers and landowners is often undertaken by the research community to obtain information relating to typical land, livestock and enterprise management and generally centres on responses to questionnaire surveys. Farmers and land managers are constituted as expert observers of ground-level processes and provide diverse information on farming practices, enterprise economics and underpinning attitudes towards risk. Research projects designed to inform policy and practice may rely on such data to understand better on-the-ground decisions that can impact on environmental quality and the rural economy. Such approaches to eliciting local-level expert knowledge can generate large quantities of data from which to formulate rules relating to farm enterprise types. In turn, this can help to inform the structure of Decision Support Systems (DSS) and risk-based tools to determine farming practices likely to impact on environmental quality. However, in this paper we advocate the need for integrated farmer participation throughout the whole research process – from project inception through to community qualitative validation and legitimation - and thus not just for the elicitation of questionnaire responses. With farm questionnaire surveys being adopted widely by the research community, it is an opportune time to highlight a recent case study of the Taw catchment, Devon, UK. This serves as an example of co-construction of a DSS via a co-ordinated and integrated approach to expert elicitation with a farmer questionnaire survey as a central methodology. The aim of the paper is to detail the core aspects of an iterative cycle of participatory environmental management and DSS development for water quality protection and consider the multiple benefits of co-ordinated programmes of engagement with the farming community in this process.},

This advice seems like common sense. However, it masks major inconsistencies, regarding different beliefs about the nature of the problem to be solved when using this advice. Furthermore, if not accompanied by critical analysis and insights from the peer-reviewed literature, it could provide misleading guidance for people new to this field.},

	abstract = {Development programs have typically neglected uncertainty and variability in terms of outcomes and socio-ecological context when promoting conservation agriculture (CA) throughout sub-Saharan Africa. We developed a simple Monte Carlo-based decision model, calibrated to global data-sets and parameterized to local conditions, to predict the range of yield beneﬁts farmers may obtain when adopting CA in two ongoing agricultural development projects in East Africa. Our general model predicts the yield effects of adopting CA-related practices average −0.60 ± 2.05 (sd) Mg maize ha−1 year−1, indicating a near equal chance of positive and negative impacts on yield. When using site-speciﬁc, socio-economic, and biophysical data, mean changes in yield were more negative (−1.29 and −1.34 Mg ha−1 year−1). Moreover, practically the entire distributions of potential yield impacts were negative suggesting CA is highly unlikely to generate yield beneﬁts for farmers in the two locations. Despite comparable aggregate effects at both sites, factors such as land tenure, access to information, and livestock pressure contrast sharply highlighting the need to quantify the range of livelihood and landscape effects when evaluating the suitability of the technology. This analysis illustrates the potential of incorporating uncertainty in rapid assessments of agricultural development interventions. Whereas this study examines project-level decisions on one speciﬁc intervention, the approach is equally relevant to address decision-making for multiple interventions, at multiple scales, and for multiple criteria (e.g., across ecosystem services), and thus is an important tool that can support linking knowledge with action.},

	abstract = {Designing and implementing biodiversity-based value chains can be a complex undertaking, especially in places where outcomes are uncertain and risks of project failure and cost overruns are high. We used the Stochastic Impact Evaluation (SIE) approach to guide the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) on viable investment options in honey value chains, which the agency considered implementing as an economic incentive for communities along the Kenya-Somalia border to conserve biodiversity. The SIE approach allows for holistic analysis of project cost, beneﬁt, and risk variables, including those with uncertain and missing information. It also identiﬁes areas that pose critical uncertainties in the project. We started by conducting a baseline survey in Witu and Awer in Lamu County, Kenya. The aim of the survey was to establish the current farm income from beekeeping as a baseline, against which the prospective impacts of intervention options could be measured. We then developed an intervention decision model that was populated with all cost, beneﬁt and risk variables relevant to beekeeping. After receiving training in making quantitative estimates, four subject-matter experts expressed their uncertainty about the proposed variables in the model by specifying probability distributions for them. We then used Monte Carlo simulation to project decision outcomes. We also identiﬁed variables that projected decision outcomes were most sensitive to, and we determined the value of information for each variable. The variable with the highest information value to the decision-maker in Witu was the honey price. In Awer, no additional information on any of the variables would change the recommendation to invest in honey value chains in the region. The analysis demonstrates a novel and comprehensive approach to decision-making for different stakeholders in a project where decision outcomes are uncertain.},

	abstract = {Governments around the world have agreed to end hunger and food insecurity and to improve global nutrition, largely through changes to agriculture and food systems. However, they are faced with a lot of uncertainty when making policy decisions, since any agricultural changes will influence social and biophysical systems, which could yield either positive or negative nutrition outcomes. We outline a holistic probability modeling approach with Bayesian Network (BN) models for nutritional impacts resulting from agricultural development policy. The approach includes the elicitation of expert knowledge for impact model development, including sensitivity analysis and value of information calculations.

on household hunger but, by influencing preferences for and access to quality nutritional foods, may increase the prevalence of micronutrient deficiency.

However, the contribution of this agrobiodiversity to food and nutrition security has rarely been explored empirically. The present study sought to assess the influence of homegarden agrobiodiversity, production system parameters, and socio-economic factors on household dietary diversity and anthropometric conditions in southwest Uganda. Plant inventories of 102 homegardens were followed by two 24-hour recalls (n=589) and anthropometric measurements (n=325) of household members, as well as food insecurity questionnaires (n=95) for households. Regression models explained between 16 and 50\% of variance in dietary diversity and between 21 and 75\% in anthropometric measurements. Results indicate that supporting diverse homegarden systems can be part of the solution to food insecurity in Uganda. Recommendations are made for further strengthening the role of homegardens towards improving dietary and anthropometric outcomes.},

	abstract = {Governments around the world seek to create programs that will support sustainable agriculture and achieve food security, yet they are faced with uncertainty, system complexity and data scarcity when making such choices. We propose decision modeling as an innovative approach to help meet these challenges and oﬀer a case study to show the eﬀectiveness of the tool. We use decision analysis tools to model the possible nutrition-related outcomes of the Ugandan government's long term agricultural development plan termed ‘Vision 2040’. The analysis indicates potential shifts in household nutritional contributions through the comparison of the current small-scale diverse systems and the envisioned industrial agricultural systems that may replace them. A Monte Carlo simulation revealed that Vision 2040 plans outperform homegardens in terms of energy and some macronutrients, yet homegardens are likely to be better at producing key vitamins and micronutrients, such as Vitamin A. Value of information calculations applied to Monte Carlo outputs further revealed that gathering more data on the annual yields and nutrient contents of staples, pulses, vegetables, and fruits could improve certainty about the nutrition contribution of both scenarios. We conclude that the development of Uganda's agricultural sector should consider the role that agrobiodiversity in the current small-scale agricultural systems plays in national food and nutrition security. Any changes according to Vision 2040 should also include farmers' voices and current crop management systems as guides for a sustainable food supply in the region. This modeling approach may be a tool for governments to consider agricultural policy implications, especially given the data scarcity and agricultural variability in regions such as East Africa.},

Yet such uncertainty is rarely effectively calculated when analysing project costs and beneﬁts. This paper presents a Bayesian Network (BN) modelling framework to calculate the costs, beneﬁts, and return on investment of a project over a speciﬁed time period, allowing for changing circumstances and trade-offs. The framework uses hybrid and dynamic BNs containing both discrete and continuous variables over multiple time stages. The BN framework calculates costs and beneﬁts based on multiple causal factors including the effects of individual risk factors, budget deﬁcits, and time value discounting, taking account of the parameter uncertainty of all continuous variables. The framework can serve as the basis for various project management assessments and is illustrated using a case study of an agricultural development project.},

	abstract = {Irrigation plays a significant role in achieving food and nutrition security in dry regions. However, detailed ex- ante appraisals of irrigation development investments are required to efficiently allocate resources and optimize returns on investment. Due to the inherent system complexity and uncertain consequences of irrigation develop- ment interventions coupled with limited data availability, deterministic cost-benefit analysis can be ineffective in guiding formal decision-making. Stochastic Impact Evaluation (SIE) helps to overcome the challenges of evaluat- ing investments in such contexts. In this paper, we applied SIE to assess the viability of an irrigation dam con- struction project in northern Ethiopia. We used expert knowledge elicitation to generate a causal model of the planned intervention's impact pathway, including all identified benefits, costs and risks. Estimates of the input variables were collected from ten subject matter experts. We then applied the SIE tools: Monte Carlo simulation, Partial Least Squares regression, and Value of Information analysis to project prospective impacts of the project and identify critical knowledge gaps. Model results indicate that the proposed irrigation dam project is highly likely to increase the overall benefits and improve food and nutrition status of local farmers. However, the overall value of these benefits is unlikely to exceed the sum of the investment costs and negative externalities involved in the intervention. Simulation results suggest that the planned irrigation dam may improve income, as well as food and nutrition security, but would generate negative environmental effects and high investment costs.},

	abstract = {Policy making for complex Social-Ecological Systems (SESs) is a multi-factorial and multi-stakeholder decision making process. Therefore, proper policy simulation in a SES should consider both the complex behavior of the system and the multi-stakeholders’ interventions into the system, which requires integrated methodological approaches. In this study, we simulate impacts of policy options on a farming community facing water scarcity in Rafsanjan, Iran, using an integrated modeling methodology combining an Agent Based Model (ABM) with Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM). First, the behavioral rules of farmers and the causal relations among environmental variables are captured with FCMs that are developed with both qualitative and quantitative data, i.e. farmers' knowledge and empirical data from studies. Then, an ABM is developed to model decisions and actions of farmers and simulate their impacts on overall groundwater use and emigration of farmers in this case study. Finally, the impacts of different policy options are simulated and compared with a baseline scenario. The results suggest that a policy of facilitating farmers' participation in management and control of their groundwater use leads to the highest reduction of groundwater use and would help to secure farmers’ activities in Rafsanjan. Our approach covers four main aspects that are crucial for policy simulation in SESs: 1) causal relationships, 2) feedback mechanisms, 3) social-spatial heterogeneity and 4) temporal dynamics. This approach is particularly useful for ex-ante policy options analysis.},

	abstract = {In decision theory models, expected value of partial perfect information (EVPPI) is an important analysis technique that is used to identify the value of acquiring further information on individual variables. EVPPI can be used to prioritize the parts of a model that should be improved or identify the parts where acquiring additional data or expert knowledge is most beneﬁcial. Calculating EVPPI of continuous variables is challenging, and several sampling and approximation techniques have been proposed. This paper proposes a novel approach for calculating EVPPI in hybrid inﬂuence diagram (HID) models (these are inﬂuence diagrams (IDs) containing both discrete and continuous nodes). The proposed approach transforms the HID into a hybrid Bayesian network and makes use of the dynamic discretization and the junction tree algorithms to calculate the EVPPI. This is an approximate solution (no feasible exact solution is possible generally for HIDs) but we demonstrate it accurately calculates the EVPPI values. Moreover, unlike the previously proposed simulation-based EVPPI methods, our approach eliminates the requirement of manually determining the sample size and assessing convergence. Hence, it can be used by decision-makers who do not have deep understanding of programming languages and sampling techniques. We compare our approach to the previously proposed techniques based on two case studies.},

	abstract = {Natural resource management is plagued with uncertainty of many kinds, but not all uncertainties are equally important to resolve. The promise of adaptive management is that learning in the short-term will improve management in the long-term; that promise is best kept if the focus of learning is on those uncertainties that most impede achievement of management objectives. In this context, an existing tool of decision analysis, the expected value of perfect information (EVPI), is particularly valuable in identifying the most important uncertainties. Expert elicitation can be used to develop preliminary predictions of management response under a series of hypotheses, as well as prior weights for those hypotheses, and the EVPI can be used to determine how much management could improve if uncertainty was resolved. These methods were applied to management of whooping cranes (Grus americana), an endangered migratory bird that is being reintroduced in several places in North America. The Eastern Migratory Population of whooping cranes had exhibited almost no successful reproduction through 2009. Several dozen hypotheses can be advanced to explain this failure, and many of them lead to very different management responses. An expert panel articulated the hypotheses, provided prior weights for them, developed potential management strategies, and made predictions about the response of the population to each strategy under each hypothesis. Multi-criteria decision analysis identiﬁed a preferred strategy in the face of uncertainty, and analysis of the expected value of information identiﬁed how informative each strategy could be. These results provide the foundation for design of an adaptive management program.},

	abstract = {Catchment managers face considerable challenges in managing ecological assets. This task is made difﬁcult by the variable and complex nature of ecological assets, and the considerable uncertainty involved in quantifying how various threats and hazards impact upon them. Bayesian approaches have the potential to address the modelling needs of environmental management. However, to date many Bayesian networks (Bn) developed for environmental management have been parameterised using knowledge elicitation only. Not only are these models highly qualitative, but the time and effort involved in elicitation of a complex Bn can often be overwhelming. Unfortunately in environmental applications, data alone are often too limited for parameterising a Bn. Consequently, there is growing interest in how to parameterise Bns using both data and elicited information. At present, there is little formal guidance on how to combine what can be learned from the data with what can be elicited. In a previous publication we proposed a detailed methodology for this process, focussing on parameterising and evaluating a Bn. In this paper, we further develop this methodology using a risk assessment case study, with the focus being on native ﬁsh communities in the Goulburn Catchment (Victoria, Australia).},
