## Seminar 5: Using git and Github {#github_git}
<!-- [Using git and Github](#github_git) -->

Welcome to the fourth seminar of **Decision Analysis and Forecasting for Agricultural Development**. All your programming and project work for this course should take place in the git environment and this seminar is intended to show you how to make that happen. Feel free to bring up any questions or concerns in the Slack or to [Dr. Cory Whitney](mailto:cory.whitney@uni-bonn.de?subject=[Seminar_4]%20Decision%20Analysis%20Lecture) or the course tutor.

### git and Github

Now we look at the programming version control environment [git](https://git-scm.com/) and the interface [github](https://github.com/), which we use to share our scripts and changes to our work.

Install Git & join Github (if you have not already):

- install Git
<small>https://git-scm.com/downloads</small>

- join Github
<small>https://github.com/</small>

Some useful tips on getting these running from our friends 

- University of Zurich

- Nathan Stephens, a very helpful R blogger

Start simple with your own repository only and work on it alone. Soon you will start to collaborate on something in git. For the project part of this course your team will work in a collective repository and work together to generate the final working project model and report.

### Sharing html files

We can use the options from `htmlpreview.github.io` to show the results of any of our html output work that is stored in our git repository. 

To do that just preface the path for the html file with `http://htmlpreview.github.io/?`. 

For example the slides for this seminar can be found in the `CWWhitney/teaching_git` repository. 

The full path is: `https://github.com/CWWhitney/teaching_git/blob/master/R_Git_GitHub.html` 

and the link to this to be viewed directly as a web page is: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/CWWhitney/teaching_git/blob/master/R_Git_GitHub.html
