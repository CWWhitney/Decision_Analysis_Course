# Seminar 2: Using R and RStudio

Welcome to the second seminar of **Decision Analysis and Forecasting for Agricultural Development**. Feel free to bring up any questions or concerns in the Slack or to [Dr. Cory Whitney](mailto:cory.whitney@uni-bonn.de?subject=[Seminar_4]%20Decision%20Analysis%20Lecture) or the course tutor.

Remember that this is an experiential course and will be based largely on work from your side that is supported by us, rather than passive learning where we deliver content. In order to work with us in this course you will need to have some basic tools.
