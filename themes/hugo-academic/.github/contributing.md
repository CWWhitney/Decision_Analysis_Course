# Contributing to Wowchemy

Thanks for being interested in contributing! We’re so glad you want to help!

We want contributing to Wowchemy to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone and everyone. All contributions are welcome, including issues, new docs as well as updates and tweaks, blog posts, workshops, and more.

## Where to Start

Join the **Contributing** channel on the **[community Discord](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb)**.

Learn [how to contribute code on Github](https://codeburst.io/a-step-by-step-guide-to-making-your-first-github-contribution-5302260a2940).

If you're a developer looking to contribute, but you're not sure where to begin, check out the [good first issue](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-modules/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) label on Github, which contains small tasks that have been specifically flagged as being friendly to new contributors.

After that, if you're looking for something a little more challenging to sink your teeth into, there's a broader [help wanted](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-modules/labels/help%20wanted) label encompassing issues which need some love.

If you have a straightforward bug fix or improvement, feel free to contribute it in a [Pull Request](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-modules/pulls).

If you have an idea for a new feature, please start by [searching the issues](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-modules/issues) to check that the feature has not already been suggested and then suggest it by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-modules/issues/new/choose), as adding new features to Wowchemy first requires some analysis around the design and spec.

### Contribute a language pack 

To contribute a **new language pack** or an improvement to a language pack, refer to the [language pack guide](https://wowchemy.com/docs/language/#create-or-modify-a-language-pack). Once created, [fork Wowchemy Hugo Modules](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-modules), place your language pack in `wowchemy/i18n/`, add the name of the language to `wowchemy/data/i18n/language.yaml`, and open a Pull Request on Github with these two files.

### Contribute a theme pack

[View the guide](https://wowchemy.com/docs/customization/#share-your-theme)

### Contribute a template

Consider forking a bare-bones template such as [Hello Starter](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hello-world) on GitHub and building up your own template using the Wowchemy Hugo Module. Reach out on the **Contributing** channel in Discord to submit your template.

### Contribute to the Publication importer

To contribute to **Hugo Academic CLI**, the automatic publication importer, refer to [its dedicated Github repository](https://github.com/wowchemy/hugo-academic-cli) and Issue queue.
