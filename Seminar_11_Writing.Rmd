## Seminar 11: Academic Writing {#writing} 
<!-- [Academic writing](#writing) -->

Welcome to the eleventh seminar of **Decision Analysis and Forecasting for Agricultural Development**.Feel free to bring up any questions or concerns in the Slack or to [Dr. Cory Whitney](mailto:cory.whitney@uni-bonn.de?subject=[Seminar_10]%20Decision%20Analysis%20Lecture) or the course tutor.

In this seminar we will build on some of the things we learned in the [Using RMarkdown](#rmarkdown) seminar. We will use [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to create a report on our R code (@R-rmarkdown). 

To run this you will need to load `library(rmarkdown)` and library(`knitr`).

### Yet Another Markup Language

- When you open an Rmarkdown file you get a defualt document with examples and also with the standard setting, as we discussed in the [Using RMarkdown](#rmarkdown) seminar. the top of the document contains information between three dashed lines like this `---`. The language within these marks is known as YAML and sets the general layout and format of your document.

### Adding citations


### Reuse chunk options

In case of repeated formatting in different code chunks we can use the `knitr` `opts.label` option to reuse what we wrote and avoid repetition (@R-knitr). Following the [Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle](https://yihui.org/en/2021/05/knitr-reuse/).
