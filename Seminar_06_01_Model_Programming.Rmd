## Seminar 6 part 1: Model Programming {#model_programming} 
<!-- reference with [Model programming](#model_programming) -->

Welcome to the model programming seminar of **Decision Analysis and Forecasting for Agricultural Development**. In this seminar we will look into different options for model programming in the `R` programming environment [@R-base]. In case you have not already installed `R` and `RStudio` you may want to go back to the [Using R and Rstudio](#r_rstudio) seminar and follow the instructions there. Feel free to bring up any questions or concerns in the Slack or to [Dr. Cory Whitney](mailto:cory.whitney@uni-bonn.de?subject=[Seminar_4]%20Decision%20Analysis%20Lecture) or the course tutor.

Remember to start simple then move on to other steps, make sure that you always have a working model at each of the steps in the process, i.e. starting with a skateboard rather than a car part as in this example from [MetaLab](https://twitter.com/metalab).

### Monte Carlo Simulation of Apples and Sheep Agroforestry 

Follow this hypothetical example of a silvopastoral system as your first Monte Carlo simulation in base R.

In this video we walk you through the process of running this model. Please follow along and write your own R script. If you ask nicely we might also share the R script.
